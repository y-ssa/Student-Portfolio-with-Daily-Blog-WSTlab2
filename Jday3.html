            <p><strong>Tuesday: Campus Wins & Long Hours</strong></p>
            <p>Today is Tuesday - a school day. I woke up early at 6:30am because I had class. No slow morning today. I went straight into my routine, ate breakfast, and prepared my things for school. By 9;00am, I left home to start my journey for my 10:00am class. Thankfully, there was no traffic, so the ride was smooth and dtress-free. Small wins like that already set a good mood for the day.</p>
            <p>I arrived about 15 minutes early, which gave me time to review a little for an upcoming quiz. A few minutes later, class officially started - and the best part? I found out I got a high score on our first quiz last week in that subject. That moment alone made waking up early worth it.</p>
            <p>After class, my friends and I ate lunch at the CS canteen. Nothing beats campus lunch with friends - simple food, loud conversations, and shared stress about academics. Later, we headed to the library to review and wait for our professor beacuse we were expecting a quiz. We stayed there for hours... reviewing, talking quietly, and mentally preparing ourselves. But plot twist: the quiz was cancelled. All that nervous ebnergy for nothing - but at least we were prepared.</p>
            <p>We then went back to CS to pick a capstone project from previous graduate batches for our activity. Seeing past projects feels motivating - like a glimpse of what we'll eventually accomplish too. After that, I decided to go home already. I ate dinner, then stepped out again to work on some school tasks. The grind doesn't stop.</p>
            <p>By 8:30pm, I finally went back home to rest. It was a long day - early wake-up, campus hours, library waiting, cancelled quiz, schoolwork at night. But today reminded me of something important: progress doesn't always look load. Sometimes it looks like showing up, reviewing even when the quiz gets cancelled, celebrating small academnic wins, and still pushing through until night.</p>
            <p>Tuesday was tiring - but fulfilling.</p>
