            <p>I went into this Sunday craving a movie marathon and a nap, but ended up in a marathon of errands instead. I’ve realized that for an IT student, a weekend of pure relaxation is nothing more than wishful thinking.</p>

            <p>I started my day working on the UI layout in Figma. My partner and I decided that before we start programming our website for our Web Systems and Technologies lab activity, we are going to design our student portfolio in Figma first. At exactly 10:00 AM, I finished my part and sent the URL to my partner so she could review and add to the design. After she reviewed the UI, we spent some time brainstorming and discussing how we would begin programming and how to divide the workload fairly. Once we finalized the plan, she created a GitHub repository and invited me as a collaborator. With the design ready and the repo set up, we are officially ready to start coding.</p>

            <p>Before the sun even began to set, that 'wishful thinking' laziness finally caught up with me. Even with only a few tasks completed, my brain was already checking out for the day. My partner started the HTML code, and since I had to wait for her to finish before I could start on the CSS, I finally gave in and watched a one-hour movie. It wasn't the marathon I originally planned, but it was exactly the break I needed.</p>

            <p>I decided to watch 'Un/Happy For You' starring Julia Barretto and Joshua Garcia. Watching it made me realize that it’s entirely possible to get tired of someone's immaturity, but not the love itself. We are only human, so it is valid to lose energy and feel drained. However, I believe that love should be what carries us, not what consumes us. The ending left me with a very important message: second chances will never go to waste if you give them to yourself.</p>

            <p>Inspired by that thought, I decided to give myself a second chance to end the day on a productive note. I spent the rest of my evening reviewing our lectures for our upcoming quiz in Web Systems and Technologies.</p>
