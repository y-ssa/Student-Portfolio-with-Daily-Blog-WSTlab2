            <p><strong>Reset: Did I actually do it?</strong></p>
            <p>Sunday. My reset day.</p>
            <p>The one day that feels like a deep breath before another busy week begins. But the real question is... did I actually pull it off today? Let's find out.</p>
            <p>I woke up at 8:30 am, my usual time when there's no class. No alarms screaming. No rushing. Just a calm start. First stop? The comfort room. Then I washed my face and headed staright for breakfast.</p>
            <p>After eating, it was time to be productive. I did the household chores assigned to me - washing the dishes and sweeping the floor. It may sound simple, but there's something satisfying about seeing everything clean. It feels like clearing not just the house, but my mind too.</p>
            <p>Of course, my reset day wouldn't be complete without taking care of my pets. I bought shampoo and prepared everything my dog needed for his bath. While waiting for some files to download (since we don't have our own internet connection at home, I had to step out for it), I made sure everything was ready.</p>
            <p>Bath time was fun - my dog actually loves it! And honestly, bathing pets means getting bathed too, so I ended up taking a bath right after. Two birds, one stone.</p>
            <p>Lunch was simple but good: rice, egg, and beans. Sometimes the simplest meals are the most comforting.</p>
            <p>After lunch, it was time to lock in. I steppped out again to work on school tasks - including this project. Hours passed, I went back home to eat and charge my gadgets. Then I reviewed my lessons for a while.</p>
            <p>But thr grind wasn't over yet. I stepped out again to continue working. I stayed productive until 8:00pm, when I decided it was time to go home. It was getting late, and being alone outside at night can feel a little scary. Back home, I ate dinner, watched some TV to relax, and finally went to sleep.</p>
            <p>So... did I achieve the reset? Maybe a reset doesn't have to be perfect. maybe it just means showing up for yourself - even in small ways. And today? I think I did.</p>
