            <p><strong>Thursday: Oversleeping & Hustle</strong></p>
            <p>Today started a little different.. and not in the "peaceful morning" way I like. I woke up at 9:15am - yes, overslept again. This seems to happen often lately. My neck was aching, probably because of a bad sleeping position. With the late start, I skipped my full morning routine and went straight to breakfast. After eating, I tackled the laundry and gave my dog a bath. Of course, that meant I had to take a bath too. By 12:00pm, I was finally done and ate lunch.</p>
            <p>The rest of the day shifted into school mode. I stepped out to work on school tasks, but then saw a new activity posted on LMS. The deadline is tomorrow, and today I also have to finish this blog with my partner. Stress levels rising. Hours passed as I focused on finishing our activity. Midway, my cousin messaged me to go to their house to try on the dress and the suit that my brother and I will wear on Saturday for her wedding. We didm't stay longer because everyone was busy preparing.</p>
            <p>When I got back home, I continued working on the activity until the evening. By the end of the day, I finally called it a day - tired, a little stressed, but accomplished. Thursday reminded me that not every day starts perfectly, but what matters is showing up, adjusting, and finishing what you started.</p>
