            <p>I started the CSS code for the blog and designed it, and I also added some elements to the HTML files. I finished everything around the afternoon. I showed the result to my partner and she approved of my design. With that settled, we started to edit the whole website and add our information and blog entries.</p>

            <p>In the evening, we started using Git Bash to commit our progress and push our work to GitHub. This was a bit of a learning curve for me, and I struggled quite a bit at first. I ran into an error where I could not push my files to the repository, and in an attempt to fix it, I used a force push. Unfortunately, that caused my partner's commits to disappear from the history, but thankfully, she was able to resolve the issue and recover the work.</p>

            <p>I think I had attempted to pull the files earlier, but I was not entirely sure how to bring the changes back into my local environment. This experience was a huge lesson for me. I now realize that to collaborate effectively on GitHub, I must always pull the latest changes made by my partner before I try to push my own. It was a stressful moment, but it definitely made me more careful with my Git commands.</p>
