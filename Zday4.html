            <p>I started my day with my daily skincare routine. My partner already uploaded the HTML files for the profile and blog pages of our website, so I focused on the CSS and design for the profile page first. While I was working, I heard a vendor selling kutsinta and sapin-sapin, so I rushed out to buy some for my breakfast. Afterward, I continued coding and spent my whole day working on that.</p>

            <p>It was 6:00 PM when I got up to cook dinner. After eating, I continued designing the website. It was already 12:00 AM by the time I finished.</p>

            <p>Since I learned some basic HTML and CSS coding, I have had a lot of fun creating websites. I have been thinking about pursuing frontend development as a career. I also planned to modify my past web development activities and add them to my personal projects.</p>
