            <p>Tuesday truly feels like the sibling of Monday, the productivity just keeps rolling. I woke up at 6:00 AM to finish my review session for our quiz later today. I used active recall for Chapter 2 and managed to dive into Chapter 3 as well. Following my usual routine, I hopped onto Gizmo for a mock quiz to lock everything in. Afterward, I shifted gears to prepare for my Networking 1 presentation on basic configuration. By 10:00 AM, I was ready and headed off to school.</p>

            <p>I had a great time during my Networking 1 lecture and even stepped up for a recitation. Although our presentation was canceled, we got our quiz scores back from last week. Seeing my results gave me the confidence I needed to dive even deeper into this major.</p>

            <p>After a quick lunch at the canteen where I squeezed in some extra review time, the waiting game began. Our professor was late, and by 2:00 PM, we still had not heard anything. It was not until 3:00 PM that he finally announced the quiz was canceled because he had forgotten to inform us earlier.</p>

            <p>Since the quiz was canceled and our professor was a no-show, my classmates and I did not want the afternoon to be a total loss. We headed over to the office to look for a capstone project to use for our Information Management assignment. Finding a solid project now is crucial because we will be responsible for creating the full Entity Relationship Diagram for it soon.</p>

            <p>Around 5:00 PM, I went to Jollibee to buy a snack because I was hungry from searching for a good topic. After that, I went home and started the CSS code for the homepage of our website.</p>
