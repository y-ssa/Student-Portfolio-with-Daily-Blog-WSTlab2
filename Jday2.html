            <p><strong>Monday: A roller Coaster Start</strong></p>
            <p>It's Monday-the official start of a brand new week. And if there's one thing I've learned, Mondays are never just "calm". They come with surprises.</p>
            <p>I woke up at 8:00am and started my usual morning routine. Nothing dramatic at forst. Just a normal start... or so I thought. Then, an unexpected visitor arrived. It was my boyfriend. We had an argument the other day, and honestly? I was still mad. So instead of greeting him sweetly, I greeted him with silence. I started doing household chores and cooked lunch, completely ignoring him. If ignoring were an Olympic sport, I would've won gold.</p>
            <p>During lunch, I was still glaring at him because he was being so annoying. I tried to stay serious, but emotions are funny sometimes. After a while-and a few exchanged words - we ended up fixing our little quarrel. Not every fight needs to be a big storm. Sometimes it just needs honesty and a little patience. Peace restored.</p>
            <p>Later on, I had to cook rice again - this time for my dog, who refuses to eat leftover rice. Yes, he's a picky eater. And yes, I spoil him anyway. After that, I stepped out to work on my school tasks. Even with the emotional roller coaster coaster earlier, responsibilities don't pause. So I did what I had to do.</p>
            <p>Dinner was simple: rice and fried chicken. Comfort food after a long day. In the evening, I studied some lessons becfore finally calling it a night.</p>
            <p>Monday came with tension, chores, schoolworks, and a little bit of love drama. But in the end, things were fixed, tasks were done, and peace was restored. If this is how the week starts, I guess I'm ready for the ride.</p>
