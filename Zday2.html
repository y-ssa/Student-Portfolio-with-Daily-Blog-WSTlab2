            <p>It was a classic Monday start for me. I woke up at 3:00 AM to get a head start on studying for our Web Systems and Technologies quiz. Since I had already started reviewing last night, I focused on active recall this morning to sharpen my memory. Eventually, the early hour caught up with me, so I crawled back into bed for a bit more sleep. I woke up again around 6:00 AM and got straight to cooking breakfast.</p>

            <p>I used Gizmo and a platform my classmate recommended to take a mock quiz and test my knowledge. I scored an 85%, which gave me a nice boost of confidence for the real thing! However, while I was right in the middle of another round, our professor suddenly announced that she couldn't meet with us this afternoon and would be rescheduling the quiz. With the pressure off, I immediately stopped reviewing and hopped onto Genshin Impact instead. Later that afternoon, I decided to stay productive in a different way and knocked out some household chores.</p>

            <p>As twilight set in, I shifted my focus back to reviewing for tomorrow’s Information Management 1 quiz. It had been such a productive day that exhaustion finally won, and I actually fell asleep right in the middle of my notes. Although I didn't quite finish Chapter 2, I decided to listen to my body and save the rest for tomorrow. A classic end to a classic Monday.</p>
